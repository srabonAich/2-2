    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Serial Binary Adder** is a digital circuit that performs binary addition **bit by bit**, starting from the **least significant bit (LSB)**. It uses a **single full adder** circuit and processes one bit per clock cycle. This approach is slower than parallel addition but uses fewer hardware resources, making it cost-effective and efficient for certain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shift Registers**:  \n",
    "   Two registers hold the binary numbers to be added. These shift right by one position each clock cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Full Adder**:  \n",
    "   A single full adder performs the addition of the corresponding bits along with the carry from the previous stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Carry Flip-Flop**:  \n",
    "   Stores the carry output from the full adder to be used in the next cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Let A and B be two binary numbers of equal length (say 4 bits):\n",
    "\n",
    "- A = A3 A2 A1 A0\n",
    "- B = B3 B2 B1 B0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step operation:\n",
    "- Step 1: Load A and B into shift registers.\n",
    "- Step 2: Initialize Carry = 0.\n",
    "- Step 3: For each clock cycle:\n",
    "  - Add LSBs of A and B along with Carry using the Full Adder.\n",
    "  - Store the sum bit in the result shift register.\n",
    "  - Update the carry using the carry-out of the full adder.\n",
    "  - Shift A and B right by one bit.\n",
    "- Step 4: After n cycles (where n is the number of bits), the result is ready.\n",

    "## Serial Binary Adder - Block Diagram\n",

    "<img src=\"Serial.jpg\">\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Full Adder Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The full adder takes three inputs: A (bit), B (bit), and Cin (carry-in), and produces:\n",
    "- Sum = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin\n",
    "- Cout = (A & B) | (B & Cin) | (A & Cin)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Add A = 1011 and B = 1101:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Cycle | A Bit | B Bit | Cin | Sum | Cout |\n",
    "|-------|-------|-------|-----|-----|------|\n",
    "| 1     | 1     | 1     | 0   | 0   | 1    |\n",
    "| 2     | 1     | 0     | 1   | 0   | 1    |\n",
    "| 3     | 0     | 1     | 1   | 0   | 1    |\n",
    "| 4     | 1     | 1     | 1   | 1   | 1    |\n",
    "| 5     | -     | -     | 1   | 1   | 0    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: **110000** (6 bits including the final carry)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires minimal hardware (only one full adder).\n",
    "- Efficient for low-speed operations or in systems where space is a constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slower than parallel adders as it processes only one bit per cycle.\n",
    "- More clock cycles needed for complete addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embedded systems with limited resources.\n",
    "- Serial communication systems.\n",
    "- Low-power arithmetic circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Serial Binary Adder is a fundamental component in digital systems where resource efficiency is prioritized over speed. It showcases how sequential logic can be used effectively to perform arithmetic operations over multiple clock cycles.\n"
