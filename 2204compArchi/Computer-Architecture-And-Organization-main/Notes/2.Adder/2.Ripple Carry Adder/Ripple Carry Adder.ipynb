    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** is a type of digital circuit used for binary addition. It is made by connecting **multiple full adders** in series, where the carry output of one full adder becomes the carry input of the next. It is called \"ripple carry\" because the carry bit **ripples** from one stage to the next.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Full Adder Units**: Each bit position uses a full adder.\n",
    "- **Carry Propagation**: The carry out from one adder is connected to the carry in of the next adder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "For two n-bit binary numbers A and B:\n",
    "- A = An-1 An-2 ... A1 A0\n",
    "- B = Bn-1 Bn-2 ... B1 B0\n",
    "\n",
    "Each bit Ai and Bi is added along with a carry-in (Ci) to produce:\n",
    "- **Sum bit (Si)**\n",
    "- **Carry-out (Ci+1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated for each bit from LSB to MSB.\n",

    "## Full Adder Logic (Per Bit)\n",
    "\n",
    "For inputs A, B, and Carry-in (Cin):\n",
    "- **Sum (S)** = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin\n",
    "- **Carry-out (Cout)** = (A & B) | (B & Cin) | (A & Cin)\n",

    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple and easy to design.\n",
    "- Scales easily by adding more full adders.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slow** for large bit-widths because carry must propagate through all previous adders.\n",
    "- **Worst-case delay** is proportional to the number of bits (O(n)).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic arithmetic logic units (ALUs).\n",
    "- Small-scale digital systems.\n",
    "- Educational and conceptual demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "A Ripple Carry Adder is the most straightforward approach to building multi-bit binary adders. While it is hardware efficient, its main drawback is **carry propagation delay**, which limits its performance for high-speed or high-bit applications.\n"
