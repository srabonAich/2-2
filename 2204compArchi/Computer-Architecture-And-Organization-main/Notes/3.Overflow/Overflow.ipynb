    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overflow** is a condition that occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation **exceeds the range** that can be represented with a fixed number of bits. It typically happens during **addition or subtraction** of binary numbers in **signed arithmetic** (especially with 2’s complement representation).\n",

    "## Types of Overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signed Overflow**\n",
    "   - Occurs when the result of an operation is too **positive or too negative** to be represented with the given number of bits.\n",
    "   - Common in 2's complement representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsigned Overflow**\n",
    "   - Occurs when the result exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the unsigned bit width.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Range of Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "### For n-bit signed numbers (2’s complement):\n",
    "- Range: `-2^(n-1)` to `2^(n-1) - 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (4-bit signed):\n",
    "- Min = `-8` (1000)\n",
    "- Max = `+7` (0111)\n",

    "### For n-bit unsigned numbers:\n",
    "- Range: `0` to `2^n - 1`\n",

    "## How to Detect Overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Unsigned Addition:\n",
    "- **Overflow occurs if** there is a **carry-out** from the MSB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Signed Addition:\n",
    "- **Overflow occurs if**:\n",
    "  - Adding two **positive numbers** yields a **negative** result.\n",
    "  - Adding two **negative numbers** yields a **positive** result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overflow Detection Rule:\n",
    "For two's complement:\n",
    "- Overflow = (Carry_in to MSB) XOR (Carry_out of MSB)\n",

    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsigned Addition (4-bit):\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1100 (12) + 1010 (10) = 10110 (22) → Truncated to 0110 (6) → Overflow occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signed Addition (4-bit 2’s complement):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overflow (Positive + Positive → Negative)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0100 (4) + 0101 (5) = 1001 (-7 in 2’s complement) → Overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overflow (Negative + Negative → Positive)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1001 (-7) + 1000 (-8) = 0001 (+1) → Overflow\n",

    "\n",
    "## Preventing Overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **wider bit-widths** for results (e.g., 5 bits for 4-bit inputs).\n",
    "- Add **overflow detection logic** in hardware.\n",
    "- Use **saturation arithmetic** (clamp to min/max values).\n",
    "- In software, check for overflows using conditions or libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- CPU and ALU design\n",
    "- Digital signal processing (DSP)\n",
    "- Embedded systems and safety-critical applications\n",
    "- High-level programming (overflow exceptions)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overflow is a critical concept in binary arithmetic, particularly in fixed-width systems. Understanding how to **detect** and **handle overflow** is essential for designing reliable arithmetic circuits and writing correct low-level software."
